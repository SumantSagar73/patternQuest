# PatternQuest — Local Run Instructions (Phase 1)

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd d:\Projects\patternQuest
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the site at the printed Vite dev URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes:
- This is Phase 1 scaffolding: 5x5 grid UI only, no gameplay logic yet.
- If you prefer Yarn: `yarn` and `yarn dev`.
